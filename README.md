# Agent Based Model for Revenge in War Simulation
This was the final project I completed for the class "Computational Analysis of Social Complexity," where we explored several fascinating topics: Graphs - Network Science, Game Theory, Blockchain, and Agent-Based Models (ABM).

In this project, I decided to combine concepts from Graphs and ABM. The original idea was to imagine two communities in conflict, starting with a minor incident where a friend of yours gets hurt. Would you seek revenge and attack the other group? What if you have friends in the other community? What if you are not strong enough to take revenge or are not a violent person?

Several factors were considered for each individual, such as velocity, health, nationality, residency, propensity for violence, strength, and desire for revenge. Each person belonged to a social network structure and had several friends represented by links, which influenced their decision to attack or not attack the opposing community.

**Fig. 1** In this image, each point represents a person. The color of the point indicates their nationality, and the position represents the community to which they belong. As you can see, there are "foreigners," people who live in a place different from their nationality.

At the end, several statistics were collected for the ABM model by changing the parameters. There was a strong relationship between the escalation of conflict and the attributes of violence and revenge in individuals.

## Learing Outomes:
- Improved technical skills in Julia programming Language and using relevant packages tools for simulation and data analysis such as Agents and Graphs.
- Gained a comprehensive understanding of how to apply concepts from Network Science and Agent-Based Models (ABM) to simulate and analyze social dynamics and conflicts.
- Integrate knowledge from multiple domains, including Graph Theory, Game Theory, and social sciences, to create a cohesive and functional model.
- Developed the ability to effectively define multiple key attributes in the agents that will evolve in a global outcome.
- Communicate findings through visualizations and written explanations, as demonstrated in the project report and video.
